# Hi there, I'm Amin! 👋
### Machine Learning Engineer | NLP Researcher | Data Scientist

I am a Master’s student in Berlin bridging the gap between raw data and intelligent decision-making. I specialize in building robust **NLP pipelines** and **predictive models** that solve real-world business and healthcare problems.

-  I’m currently working on **Advanced Transfer Learning for Low-Resource Languages**
-  I recently published research on **Mental Health Detection using BERT & RoBERTa**
-  Open to **Working Student** & **Entry-Level** roles in ML/AI
